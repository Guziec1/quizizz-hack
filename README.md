# How does it work?<br>
It works as a discord bot, there are 2 commands to use: <br>
!class [code to the game] -> use when the game is reserved to class only<br>
!noclass [code to the game] -> use when the game is open for anyone<br>
After use of the command within 5-10 seconds bot should respond with list of questions and answers<br>
